This is a radiation treatment plan using patient images derived from 
the POPI-model, a point-validated pixel-based breathing thorax model.  
For details, see the POPI web site:

Treatment plan was designed as an SBRT-style treatment, using a 
combination of dynamic conformal arcs and fixed beams.  The treatment 
planning software was XiO 4.60.  The GTV was contoured on exhale phase, 
and no CTV margin was used.  The PTV margin was 1 cm in the inferior 
direction, and 5mm in the remaining directions.
